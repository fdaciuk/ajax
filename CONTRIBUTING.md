# Contributing

- Fork it!
- Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`;

## Running

You need to install `gulp`, `mocha` and `istanbul` globally:

```sh
[sudo] npm i -g gulp mocha istanbul
```

After that, you need to install local modules:

```sh
npm i
```

Then, you can start the webserver and execute tests with the following command:

```sh
npm watch
```

When you're ready, continue with next steps:

- Write tests;
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`;
- Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
- Submit a pull request :D
